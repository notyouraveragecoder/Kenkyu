## Kenkyu

A user-friendly, research assistant that can help you out while you read a research paper. 

Of course, reading a paper is confusing, and kind of hard, but with Kenkyu, we solve these problems! Although still in its infancy, we aim to grow it as time passes.

This chatbot makes a connection between the various APIs that can aid a researcher. e.g. Find them the research paper they're looking for, find similar research paper, look through confusing terms etc.

Following are the bot triggers

1. What are some trending research papers?
2. I want to scrape all the images from this paper.
3. What does the following word/phrase mean?
4. I want to search and download this paper.
5. What is this research paper about?

To run the bot, please use the default environment provided by Zulip, and then execute `zulip-terminal kenkyu`
