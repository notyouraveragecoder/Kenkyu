## Kenkyu

An user-friendly, research assistant that can help you out while you read a research paper. 

Of course, reading a paper is confusing, and kind of hard, but with Kenkyu, we solve these problems! Although still in its infancy, we aim to grow it as time passes.

This chatbot makes a connection between the various APIs that can aid a researcher. e.g. Find them the research paper they're looking for, find similar research paper, look through confusing terms etc.

Following are some examples of bot triggers

1. What are some trending research papers?
2. I want to scrape all the images from this paper.
3. What does the following word mean? 
4. I want to search and download this paper.
5. What is this research paper about?

To run the bot, please use the default environment provided by Zulip, and then execute `zulip-terminal kenkyu`
